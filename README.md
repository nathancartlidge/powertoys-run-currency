### Automatic Installation (`winget`)
*This doesn't work yet, sorry!*

### Manual Installation
1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/nathancartlidge/powertoys-run-unicode/releases/latest) and download the
   `.zip` file that matches your architecture - this is probably `x64` if you are unsure.
2. Close PowerToys
3. Locate your plugin installation folder: for me, this was `~\AppData\Local\Microsoft\PowerToys\PowerToys Run\Plugins`
4. Copy the plugin folder (`CurrencyConverter`) from the release into this folder (such that the path
   `...\PowerToys Run\Plugins\CurrencyConverter\` exists)
5. Open PowerToys and enable the plugin!
